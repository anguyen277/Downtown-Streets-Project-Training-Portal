Files here are for the DST Training Portal

There is currently an HTML and JS file. There is also a CSS file but it's blank. Because it's blank, I can't upload it here yet.

HTML shows how the quiz. I'm not done with this.
JS has a function to let the submit button work. Not done with this later, but I'm assuming we'll make functions here to check answers from the quiz.
I don't know what the CSS part will do yet.

I'm just using these files to see how we would make a quiz. I'm not sure how we would integrate it with PHP yet.
